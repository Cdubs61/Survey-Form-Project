This is a simple survey form project that I created as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. The objective of this project was to design and code a responsive survey form that fulfills certain user stories and requirements.

## Project Overview

### Project Requirements

The project required the following user stories to be satisfied:

- **User Story #1:** I can see a title with an `id="title"` in H1-sized text.
- **User Story #2:** I can see a short explanation with an `id="description"` in P-sized text.
- **User Story #3:** I can see a form with an `id="survey-form"`.
- **User Story #4:** Inside the form element, I am required to enter my name in a field with an `id="name"`.
- **User Story #5:** Inside the form element, I am required to enter an email in a field with an `id="email"`.
- **User Story #6:** If I enter an email that is not formatted correctly, I will see an HTML5 validation error.
- **User Story #7:** Inside the form, I can enter a number in a field with an `id="number"`.
- **User Story #8:** I can enter a text area with an `id="comments"`.
- **User Story #9:** I can select an option from a dropdown with an `id="dropdown"`.
- **User Story #10:** I can select either "In-Person" or "Online" for how I shopped with the radio buttons.
- **User Story #11:** I can check multiple checkboxes with the options "I am happy with my experience," "I had difficulty/issues with my purchase," and "I am satisfied with my purchase."
